Flight fare prediction is a process of estimating the price of airline tickets for a given route and set of travel parameters. It involves analyzing historical flight data, including factors such as departure location, destination, date of travel, airline, class, and other relevant variables, to develop a model that can predict the fare for future flights.

The goal of flight fare prediction is to provide accurate fare estimates to travelers, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking their flights. It helps travelers plan their travel budget, compare prices across different airlines, and find the best deals.

The prediction models for flight fares typically employ machine learning algorithms, such as regression, Random forest Regressor. These models are trained on historical flight data, which includes information about past flights, such as departure and arrival times, flight duration, number of stops, and corresponding ticket prices.
